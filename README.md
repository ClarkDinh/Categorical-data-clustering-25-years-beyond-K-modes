# Categorical Data Clustering: 25 Years Beyond K-modes

## Overview
This repository collects Python source codes for clustering categorical data from GitHub. It provides a platform to evaluate and compare various clustering algorithms.

## Datasets Evaluated
We confirm the performance of the clustering algorithms using the following commonly used datasets:
- Mushroom
- Soybean
- Zoo
- Congressional Voting Records

## Validation Metrics
We use four external validation metrics for comparison:
- **Accuracy**
- **Purity**
- **Normalized Mutual Information (NMI)**
- **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)**
